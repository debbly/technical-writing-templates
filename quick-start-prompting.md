# Quick Start Build with Prompting
This is an instructional guide and template of how to use a GPT to help build your quickstart. 

Collect the necessary information you need to build up a prompt, that might be information that is more specific to the tool you are talking about. 

Take the example of writing a quickstart for using the OpenWeather API. 

The core components to know about the API is 
1) getting an API key from the OpenWeather platform 
2) how to call the API
3) the expected response from the API

Calling the API

```js
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={API key}
```

where the parameters are:

lat (required): Latitude, decimal (-90; 90). 
lon	(required):	Longitude, decimal (-180; 180). 
appid (required): unique API key (find it on the account page under the "API key" tab)

An example response from the API:

When we have both those pieces of information, we can use something like the quickstart template and pass that along to the GPT (Chat GPT, Claude, choose your favorite).

The prompt might look something like:

```
Construct a quick start guide for the OpenWeatherMap One Call API. This API is called through this request `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={API key}`

Where the required portions are:
lat (required): Latitude, decimal (-90; 90). 
lon	(required):	Longitude, decimal (-180; 180). 
appid (required): unique API key (find it on the account page under the "API key" tab)

And an example of the API results looks like

```json

   "lat":33.44,
   "lon":-94.04,
   "timezone":"America/Chicago",
